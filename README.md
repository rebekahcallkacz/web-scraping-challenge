## Description
This project scrapes data related to NASA's mission to Mars and displays it on an html page.

## Method
This project scrapes data from websites with information regarding Mars, stores this data in a MongoDB database and then displays this data on an html page using a Flask app. The Flask app is dynamic and allows the user to re-scrape the data and view an updated version of the data on the page. 

A screenshot of the webpage is included here.
